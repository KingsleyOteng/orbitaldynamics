Takoradi is Ghana’s third largest city; it bad been considered post-independence a student town with  lots of technical colleges and secondary schools, more traditionally. As the capital of Ghana’s Western Region, Takoradi in more recent times has become a leading industrial and commercial hub in Western Africa. The community here is very warm and rather easy-going. Takoradi is noted as being Ghana’s first deep seaport and therefore serves an important role for export-imports. The development of the "Mahogany-1” exploration well in 2007 and subsequent developments in the deep-water West Cape Three Points block of Ghana, lead to a rapid growth in the socioeconomic profile of Takoradi.
