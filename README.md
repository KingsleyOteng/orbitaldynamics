TITLE: NORAD TLE's

DESCRIPTION:

The US Air Force provides data for Earth-orbiting satellites in Two-Line Orbital Element Sets (TLE). A derivation of 
the Two-Line Element set format called the Three-Line Element set exists where the first line contains the name of the 
satellite. These element sets are general perturbation mean elements constructed by a least squares estimation from 
observations. The Air Force provides the observations taken from the Space Surveillance Network, and FreeFlyer provides 
the capability of simulating observations to generate TLEs. 

Most TLEs generated by the Air Force are publicly available on the internet at space-track.org or CelesTrak.

The mean values are constructed by removing periodic variations in the force model due to the oblateness of the Earth, atmospheric drag, and lunar and solar gravitational effects. In order to obtain good predictions from the TLE, the periodic variations must be reconstructed in exactly the same way they were removed. FreeFlyer's Norad propagator type (which implements the SGP4/SDP4 algorithm) provides the means of reconstructing the variations, thus enabling the proper propagation of TLE states
